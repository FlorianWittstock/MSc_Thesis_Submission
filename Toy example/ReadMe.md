# Toy Example

This repo provides the code accompanying the toy example of my master thesis. In `TARIS.py` we have displayed all functions necessary to compute both TABI and TARIS for this specific experiment.


If anything is unclear, doesn't work, or you just have questions please create an issue, I'll try to get back to you.
